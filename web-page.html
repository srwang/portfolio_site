		<h3>In 2014, while I was working as a grant writer, I began learning photoshop, HTML, and CSS, as a way to supplement my writing/editing skills. I realized that I really enjoyed all of these courses and that web development was where layout and "puzzle-thinking"â€‹ intersected. I just finished training as a Full-Stack Developer at General Assembly's 12-week Web Development Immersive course. I love all the steps of making a website come to life- executing a functional interface, writing a visually pleasing design, and living inside/working through an intricate piece of code.</h3>
